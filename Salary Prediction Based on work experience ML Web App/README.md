# flask-salary-predictor
This is project predicts the salary of the employee based on the experience.

# Model
model.py trains and saves the model to the disk.
model.pkb the pickle model 

# App
app.py contains all the requiered for flask and to manage APIs.

# Salary Prediction Based on work experience ML Web App.
The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type. The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type.

Data The data for this model is fairly simplified as it has very few missing pieces. The raw data consists of a training dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries.

# Information Used To Predict Salaries Years Experience: 
How many years of experience.

This model can be used as a guide when determining salaries since it shows reasonable predictions when given information on years of experience.
